<strong>Problem 1</strong>: Prove Euler’s Formula using induction on the number of vertices and edges of <em>G</em>. (The Diestel book gives an induction only on edges.)

<strong>Problem 2</strong>: Prove that every connected plane graph has a vertex with degree less than 6.

<strong>Problem 3</strong>: Prove that a set of edges in a connected plane graph <em>G </em>forms a spanning tree of <em>G </em>if and only if the duals of the remaining edges form a spanning tree of <em>G</em><sup>∗</sup>.

<strong>Problem 4</strong>: Let <em>G </em>and <em>G</em><sup>∗ </sup>be mutually dual plane graphs. Prove that if <em>G </em>is 2-connected then <em>G</em><sup>∗ </sup>is

2-connected.
